Hello! This is my personal website, where you can know me better.<!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag --><p></p>
<p>My name is Emir. From Turkey but living in Greece. 27 years old.</p> <!-- bitlagbitlagbitlagbitlagbitlagbitlag -->
<p> I used to work as a game designer, mostly designed and built games for children who needs special education. After discovering the security world, I was immediately amazed and into it. And now, I'd like to prefer calling myself a security noob and wannabe hacker.</p><!-- delaydelaydelaydelaydelaydelaydelay -->
<p>I started to learn hacking basics and doing bug bounties. Firstly I've tried to add my name to hall of fame lists as much as possible and collect swags! <br><br><br>You can find some of the swags I've collected here. <a href="link"> Here you go</a>.</p><!-- moredelaymoredelaymoredelaymoredelaymoredelaymoredelay-->
